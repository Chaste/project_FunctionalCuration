Title: Possibilities for SED-ML
Authors: Jonathan Cooper, Gary Mirams, ?Ozzy
Abstract:
We have been working on defining and using virtual experiments within a variety of contexts, including cardiac electrophysiology, multi-cellular tissue dynamics, immunology, and synthetic biology.  In doing so we have found that extensions are required if SED-ML is to address our needs.  This talk will introduce some of our use cases, highlight our functional curation framework (https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/FunctionalCuration) for running experiments on a range of models, and outline our proposals for SED-ML.

 * Use cases
   * Cardiac model curation
     * Emphasise same proto on diff model etc.
     * st-st and/or dynamic restitution
   * Cell-based Chaste parameter sweeping
   * BME?  (Maybe just side mention)
 * Extension proposals (make clear which I've implemented)
   * New task hierarchy: task, nestedTask, combinedTask
   * Challenges of handling n-d data
     * Enhance taskReference on variable: task:subtask
   * Enhance target attr on variable: #id and onto terms
     * Or use additional optional attrs
   * Units conversions? - hard to do without cross-lang units support
   * Chaining data generators using #id variable targets
   * Equivalents of our libraries & imports?
     * Maybe just a simple merge for the latter, initially
   * Being able to represent a timecourse as nested/oneStep
     * Requires specifying and setting task/simulation/algorithm parameters
