\begin{abstract}
We have been working on defining and using virtual experiments within a variety of contexts, including cardiac electrophysiology, multi-cellular tissue dynamics, immunology, and synthetic biology.  In doing so we have found that extensions are required if SED-ML is to address our needs.  This talk will introduce some of our use cases, highlight our functional curation framework (\url{https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/FunctionalCuration}) for running experiments on a range of models, and outline our proposals for SED-ML.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection*{Main}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What problem are we trying to solve?}
% Big picture context of our research.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item How can the whole modelling process be improved?
\item How can models be reused and composed reliably?
\item Especially as models increase in size and complexity
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item We want \ldots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<.-> A single model description that can be used/analysed in multiple ways
  \item Separation of model structure (i.e.\ the equations describing biological function) and experimental scenario
  \item A uniform approach to model fitting, simulation, comparison and validation
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A \alert{model} is a purposeful simplification of reality
\item An \alert{experiment} is the process of stimulating a system to elicit observable responses
\item A \alert{protocol} is a set of detailed instructions for carrying out an experiment
  \subitem{Environmental conditions / parameters, interventions, recordings, filtering \& post-processing, numerical algorithms, etc.}
\end{itemize}

\section[Use cases]{Main use cases}
\subsection*{Main}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Use cases}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional curation of cardiac cell models
\item Parameter sweeping models of multi-cellular tissue dynamics
\item Experiments in immunology and synthetic biology
 % Won't talk about this in detail, just mention, along with text syntax
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Functional curation of cardiac models}
\begin{itemize}
\item Our original application; see also \doi[last year's talk]{10.1038/npre.2011.6327.1}
\item Aim to create a comprehensive library of electrophysiology
  protocols, and screen the models in the CellML model repository
\item One protocol that demonstrates new features since last year is
  finding a ``steady state'' for a given pacing rate
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Pacing to ``steady state''}
% Regular stimulus causes action potential; cell returns to rest.
% Nest this entire protocol, repeating until the rest state is unchanging
% (to a given threshold on norm of differences in state variables).
% Demonstrates nested protocols, while loops.

% Refer back to Ozzy's talk.
% Look at distribution of cell division events in space, cell ages at division.
% Look at effects of parameter variation on whether mutant invades or is swept out.
% Look at how these results vary across models.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Our framework}
% This may be better at end of intro?
% Just want to make point that this is real, there's software you can download
% to run these.
% Also emphasise not pushing our lang - was developed to play with ideas with
% no pre-conceptions - want to improve SED-ML
% Emphasise want our tools to run SED-ML

\section{Proposals for SED-ML}
\subsection*{Main}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Some proposals for SED-ML}
\begin{itemize}
\item \hyperlink{prop:anymodel}{Applying a protocol to any model}
  \subitem{\hyperlink{prop:onto}{Using ontological annotations}}
\item \hyperlink{prop:tasks}{New task hierarchy}
  \subitem{Split up \sedml{repeatedTask}}
\item \hyperlink{prop:varref}{Extending variable references}
  \subitem{Chaining post-processing}
\item (\hyperlink{prop:nd}{Handling n-dimensional data})
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}<1>[label=prop:anymodel]{Proposal 1: Applying a protocol to any model}
\alert{Problem}:
 In order to compare models under a given protocol, we require that
 the protocol does not hardcode the model to use.

\alert{Proposal}:
 Allow the \sedml{source} attribute on \sedml{model} to hold a special
 SED-ML URN, \sedml{urn:sedml:anymodel} say, that signals to
 processing software that the specific model must be supplied by some
 external mechanism.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}<1>[label=prop:onto]{Proposal 1: Accessing model variables}
\alert{Problem}:
 Different models may use different names for the same concept.  How
 can a single protocol be applied to both?

 \alert{Ontological annotation} can provide a consistent nomenclature.

 Model and protocol need to agree on ontology to use.

\alert{Proposal}:
 Allow the \sedml{variable} element to use an ontology term instead of
 an XPath expression.

 Either in the \sedml{target} attribute itself, or a new
 \sedml{annotatedTarget} attribute.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Emphasise that I like Frank's ideas!
% Put something in the slide text to this effect.
\begin{frame}<1>[label=prop:tasks]{Proposal 2: New task hierarchy}
\alert{Problem}:
 Frank's proposed \sedml{repeatedTask} conflates concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Associating a model with a simulation
\item Repeating a task (potentially with changes)
\item Grouping tasks to be run together (in sequence or parallelisable)
\end{itemize}

\alert{Proposal}:
 Separate them into separate classes:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{task_uml}
\end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile=singleslide]
\frametitle{Proposal 2: Examples (1)}
\begin{blksedml}
<!-- Test when order matters -->
<combinedTask id="seq" scheduling="sequential">
    <listOfSubTasks>
        <subTask task="task1" resetModel="false"/>
        <subTask task="task2" resetModel="false"/>
    </listOfSubTasks>
</combinedTask>

<!-- Test when order does not matter -->
<combinedTask id="para" scheduling="parallel">
    <listOfSubTasks>
        <subTask task="task1" resetModel="true"/>
        <subTask task="task2" resetModel="true"/>
    </listOfSubTasks>
</combinedTask>
\end{blksedml}
\end{frame}
        
\begin{frame}[fragile=singleslide]
\frametitle{Proposal 2: Examples (2)}
\begin{blksedml}
<!-- Test nesting a combined task -->
<nestedTask id="nested" resetModel="false"
            range="loop_counter">
    <listOfRanges>
        <vectorRange id="loop_counter">
            <value>0</value>
            <value>1</value>
            <value>2</value>
        </vectorRange>
    </listOfRanges>
    <subTask task="para"/>
</nestedTask>
        
<!-- Test combined inside combined -->
<combinedTask id="c_in_c" scheduling="sequential">
    <listOfSubTasks>
        <subTask task="seq" resetModel="false"/>
    </listOfSubTasks>
</combinedTask>
\end{blksedml}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile=singleslide]
\frametitle{Proposal 2: Getting the results out}
\alert{Problem}:
 Repeated and combined tasks lead to more complex results data
 structures than the vectors in SED-ML L1V1.

\begin{itemize}
\item Repeated tasks yield n-dimensional arrays
      --- see \hyperlink{prop:nd}{later}
\item Combined tasks yield ``sub-results''
% Can't just stick results together if sub-tasks might not be sequential
\end{itemize}

\alert{Proposal}:
 Enhance the \sedml{taskReference} attribute on \sedml{variable} to be
 able to indicate sub-tasks,
 e.g.\ \sedml{taskReference="task:subtask"}.

Continuing the examples from earlier:
\begin{blksedml}
<variable id="para_V1" taskReference="para:task1"
          target="..."/>
<variable id="nested_V1" taskReference="nested:task1"
          target="..."/>
\end{blksedml}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}<1>[label=prop:varref]{Proposal 3: Accessing protocol variables}
\alert{Problem}:
 Sometimes we want to refer to variables defined in the
 \emph{protocol}, not the model.

\begin{itemize}
\item
 Data generators cannot currently take the outputs of other data
 generators as inputs.
\item
 Changes in nested tasks need to refer to range values.
\end{itemize}

\alert{Proposal}:
 Most SED-ML elements already have an \sedml{id} attribute.

 Allow the \sedml{variable} element to reference these, either with
 \sedml{target="\#id"}, or a new attribute \sedml{idref}.
 % FB used target="#current" in the nested proposal v3
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile=singleslide]{Proposal 3: Changing algorithm parameters}
% This needs to be after the new task hierarchy
\alert{Problem}:
 We might want to vary algorithm parameters over a repeated task.

\alert{Proposal}:
 If \sedml{algorithmParameter} gains an (optional) \sedml{id}, the
 referencing scheme proposed earlier suffices.

\vspace{.8cm}
Example: a timecourse simulation implemented using a repeated task.
\begin{blksedml}
modelTask id="singlestep"
  simulationReference to
    oneStep with algorithmParameter id="solveTo"

repeatedTask id="timecourse" resetModel="false"
  uniformRange id="time" start="0.0" end="10.0"
  setValue target="#solveTo" range="time"
  subTask task="singlestep"
\end{blksedml}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Ideas for future proposals}
\subsection*{Main}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}<1>[label=prop:nd]{Proposal 4: Handling n-dimensional data}
\begin{itemize}
%\item
%  In SED-ML at present, the data generators implicitly map MathML
%  operators element-wise over result vectors
\item
  With nesting of tasks, results may have arbitrary dimensionality
\item
  Standard MathML has no facilities for dealing with such data types
\item
  We can define new \texttt{csymbol}s for operations such as
  extracting sub-arrays, creating new arrays, explicit maps, and
  `folds' (see \doi[last year's talk]{10.1038/npre.2011.6327.1})
% Mention that array creation makes it easy to define vectors like in
% Stuart Moodie's email.
\item
  This should ideally be done in concert with NuML
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% Solicit opinions on how important these operations are, and where
% more complex post-processing should really go - is it better to use
% another language?


\begin{frame}{Looking further ahead}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Units conversions
  \subitem{Requires a units standard across modelling languages}
\item Protocol libraries
\item Dealing with irregular data
  \subitem{e.g.\ arising from cell birth and death}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
