abstract ={Computational models of cardiac electrophysiology are exemplar demonstrations of the integration of multiple data sets into a consistent biophysical framework. These models encapsulate physiological understanding to provide quantitative predictions of function. The combination or extension of existing models within a common framework allows integrative phenomena in larger systems to be investigated. This methodology is now routinely applied, as demonstrated by the increasing number of studies which use or extend previously developed models. In this study, we present a meta-analysis of this model re-use for two leading models of cardiac electrophysiology in the form of parameter inheritance trees, a sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the functional significance of the sodium potassium pump for defining restitution curves. These results indicate that even though the models aim to represent the same physiological system, both the sources of parameter values and the function of equivalent components are significantly different.},

abstract = {Predicting information about human physiology and pathophysiology from genomic data is a compelling, but unfulfilled goal of post-genomic biology. This is the aim of the so-called Physiome Project and is, undeniably, an ambitious goal. Yet if we can exploit even a small proportion of the rich and varied experimental data currently available, significant insights into clinically important aspects of human physiology will follow. To achieve this requires the integration of data from disparate sources into a common framework. Extrapolation of available data across species, laboratory techniques and conditions requires a quantitative approach. Mathematical models allow us to integrate molecular information into cellular, tissue and organ-level, and ultimately clinically relevant scales. In this paper we argue that biophysically detailed computational modelling provides the essential tool for this process and, furthermore, that an appropriate framework for annotating, databasing and critiquing these models will be essential for the development of integrative computational biology.}

    abstract = {In this era of widespread broadband Internet penetration and powerful Web browsers on most desktops, a shift in the publication paradigm for physiome-style models is envisaged. No longer will model authors simply submit an essentially textural description of the development and behaviour of their model. Rather, they will submit a complete working implementation of the model encoded and annotated according to the various standards adopted by the physiome project, accompanied by a traditional human-readable summary of the key scientific goals and outcomes of the work. While the final published, peer-reviewed article will look little different to the reader, in this new paradigm, both reviewers and readers will be able to interact with, use and extend the models in ways that are not currently possible. Here, we review recent developments that are laying the foundations for this new model publication paradigm. Initial developments have focused on the publication of mathematical models of cellular electrophysiology, using technology based on a CellML- or Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)-encoded implementation of the mathematical models. Here, we review the current state of the art and what needs to be done before such a model publication becomes commonplace.},

@article{Nickerson*.08:Reference,
    abstract = {In recent years there has been much development of the fundamental ideas underlying mathematical model curation in regard to models of biology. While much has been achieved in the realms of systems biology and bioinformatics, little progress has been made in relation to cellular electrophysiology modeling. The primary reason for slow progress in this field is the lack of a consistent and machine-readable reference description for a given model. CellML has been widely used to describe mathematical models of cellular electrophysiology in an unambiguous, machine-readable format. Through the use of well-annotated CellML models we propose a standard by which reference descriptions of cellular electrophysiology models can be similarly defined in an unambiguous, software independent, and machine-readable format. Adoption of this standard will provide a consistent technology by which cellular electrophysiology models can be curated. AVAILABILITY: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/compbiolab/p2/},

There already exist widely-accepted formats to encode the structure of models. However, the problem of describing the simulations to be run using those models has not yet been tackled in a satisfactory way. The community believes that providing detailed information about simulation recipes will highly improve the efficient use of existing models. Accordingly a set of guidelines called the Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) is currently under development. It covers information about the simulation settings, including information about the models, changes on them, simulation settings applied to the models and output definitions. Here we present the Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML), an XML format that enables the storage and exchange of part of the information required to implement the MIASE guidelines. SED-ML is independent of the formats used to encode the models --- as long as they are expressed in XML ---, and it is independent of the software tools used to run the simulations. Several test implementations are being developed to benchmark SED-ML on simple cases, and pave the way to a more complete support of MIASE.},

Several data standards have been adopted for representing models (Systems Biology Markup Language) and various types of relevant experimental data (such as {FuGE} and those of the Proteomics Standards Initiative). However, until now, there has been no standard way to associate a model and its entities to the corresponding datasets, or vice versa. Such a standard would provide a means to represent computational simulation results as well as to frame experimental data in the context of a particular model. Target applications include model-driven data analysis, parameter estimation, and sharing and archiving model {simulations.Results}: We propose the Systems Biology Results Markup Language ({SBRML}), an {XML}-based language that associates a model with several datasets. Each dataset is represented as a series of values associated with model variables, and their corresponding parameter values. {SBRML} provides a flexible way of indexing the results to model parameter values, which supports both spreadsheet-like data and multidimensional data cubes. We present and discuss several examples of {SBRML} usage in applications such as enzyme kinetics, microarray gene expression and various types of simulation {results.Availability} and Implementation: The {XML} Schema file for {SBRML} is available at {http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/SBRML} under the Academic Free License ({AFL}) {v3.0.Contact}: {pedro.mendes@manchester.ac.ukSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It introduces n-dimensional arrays combined with a type system that supports hierarchies of array types with varying shape information as well as a shape-invariant form of array comprehension called WITH-loop. Together, these constructs allow for a programming style similar to that of array programming languages such as APL. We use Single Assignment C (SAC), a functional C-variant aimed at numerical applications that is based on the proposed design, to demonstrate that programs written in that style can be compiled to code whose runtime performance is competitive with that of hand-optimized Fortran programs. However, essential prerequisites for such performance figures are a shape inference system integrated in the type system as well as several high-level optimizations. Most notably of these is With Loop Folding, an optimization technique for eliminating intermediate arrays.},

@article{Romero*.09:Impact,
    abstract = {{Abnormalities in repolarization and its rate dependence are known to be related to increased proarrhythmic risk. A number of repolarization-related electrophysiological properties are commonly used as preclinical biomarkers of arrhythmic risk. However, the variability and complexity of repolarization mechanisms make the use of cellular biomarkers to predict arrhythmic risk preclinically challenging. Our goal is to investigate the role of ionic current properties and their variability in modulating cellular biomarkers of arrhythmic risk to improve risk stratification and identification in humans. A systematic investigation into the sensitivity of the main preclinical biomarkers of arrhythmic risk to changes in ionic current conductances and kinetics was performed using computer simulations. Four stimulation protocols were applied to the ten Tusscher and Panfilov human ventricular model to quantify the impact of ±15 and ±30\% variations in key model parameters on action potential (AP) properties, Ca2+ and Na+ dynamics, and their rate dependence. Simulations show that, in humans, AP duration is moderately sensitive to changes in all repolarization current conductances and in L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) and slow component of the delayed rectifier current (IKs) inactivation kinetics. AP triangulation, however, is strongly dependent only on inward rectifier K+ current (IK1) and delayed rectifier current (IKr) conductances. Furthermore, AP rate dependence (i.e., AP duration rate adaptation and restitution properties) and intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ levels are highly sensitive to both ICaL and Na+/K+ pump current (INaK) properties. This study provides quantitative insights into the sensitivity of preclinical biomarkers of arrhythmic risk to variations in ionic current properties in humans. The results show the importance of sensitivity analysis as a powerful method for the in-depth validation of mathematical models in cardiac electrophysiology.}},
